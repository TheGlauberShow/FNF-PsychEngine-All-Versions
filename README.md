# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine 0.6.3

## Production:
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run `haxelib remove linc_luajit` into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.

If you want video support on your mod, simply do `haxelib install hxCodec` on a Command prompt/PowerShell.
otherwise, you can delete the "VIDEOS_ALLOWED" Line on Project.xml

# Features

## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua or .hx files inside of the source code, making your own weeks without external methods, more faster!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu.
* Just adding the mod assets in the "mods" folder and compile and done!
